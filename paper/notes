Todo:

* Reviewer 1

** Seems to worry about the novelty of the theoretical work
** Need to mention about possible connections between routing games and multi-armed bandit (new information per turn etc...)
** "There are some results on the convergence of potential games,
see the work of Shamma, for example. Are those results related to
Theorem 1?"
** Elaborate on players who participated in the game


* Reviewer 2

** Definition 1 is stronger than classical Nash
** Typo in equation 2 (fixed).


* Reviewer 3

** Axes in Figure 1 is too small to read, I can increase the font size?

* Reviewer 4

** Wants legend on Figure 5, I guess we can add it in or state it in the caption? I thought it followed from the Figure 3.
** Concerned about notation inconsistencies with the probability simplex
** Wants us to include estimation error average.
** Wants to discuss irrational behavior, negative etas

* Reviewer 5

** Fix notational inconcsistencies
** I think we should explain \Delta^{P_k} in the first equation of Section 1.2?
** Address negative learning rates

* Reviewer 6

** Works has shown distributed convergence without full information. So we might change the introduction section
** Concerns about notations in Section 1.2 as with other previous reviewers
** Concerns about negative learning rates
** Concerns about Section 3, the reviewer's comments are more in detail
